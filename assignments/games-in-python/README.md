### 🛠️	Hangman Game

#### Description
Create a Hangman game where the program randomly selects a secret word from a predefined list and the player guesses letters to reveal it. The game should display the current progress in a masked format (e.g., _ a _ _ m _ n), accept single-letter guesses, and update the number of remaining attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list.
- Accept single-letter guesses and display current progress (e.g., _ a _ _ m _ n).
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining.
- End the game when the word is fully guessed or when attempts are exhausted.
- Display clear win or lose messages and reveal the word on loss.

#### Example
Input/Output (illustrative):

```
Secret word: python
Progress: _ _ _ _ _ _
Guess: p
Progress: p _ _ _ _ _
Guess: z
Incorrect guesses remaining: 5
```
